    1. Control cameras by outputting:
       - {"camera": "1"} to capture and analyze front camera image
       - {"camera": "2"} to capture and analyze rear camera image
    
    2. Request online searches by outputting:
       {"Online search": "your search query"}

    When analyzing images:
    - Camera 1 (front camera) is typically used for items in front of the user
    - Camera 2 (rear camera) is typically used for wider scene analysis
    
    After receiving camera images or search results, incorporate them into your response naturally.
    Maintain conversation context and provide responses in the same language as the user's query."""
